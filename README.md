# Python Application Task

Create a Python Application that:

1. Reads JSON from an API
2. Inserts the data into RedisJSON
3. Performs processing to produce 3 outputs using tools such as matplotlib for
   charts, aggregation functions, searches, etc.

## Requirements

- Your Python application should use Python Classes, not plain scripting as
  shown in lecture notes.
- The code must contain necessary DocStrings.
- Code alignment should be neat and clear.
- Code should be pushed to a public GitHub repository. (Manual uploads are not
  permitted)

## Submission

- A GitHub URL to your repository.
- Take screenshots of your input/output (they should be clearly visible). Add
  these screenshots to a Google Document and share the URL.

## URL Guidelines

- The URLs should be clickable,
- Shared appropriately,
- No email notification should be sent upon sharing.

**Please note: You will lose 5 points for every requirement you miss or skip,
such as not using Python classes, missing docstrings, manually uploading to
Github, untidy code alignment, or not following URL guidelines.**
